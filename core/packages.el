;;; Commentary:
;; Package management and use-package setup
;; Note: Package initialization is handled in init.el

;;; Code:

;; This file is intentionally minimal since package setup is done in init.el
;; You can add additional package-related configuration here if needed

(provide 'packages)
;;; packages.el ends here
